        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A lovely, crispy wffle perfect for the morning.</p>
        <p>Honestly, I feel like waffles are very underrated compared to their pancake and french toast counterparts.
            Like whoever thinks of a sexy breakfast and includes waffles? <strong>NOBODY</strong> that's who.
        Today we change that though. Today with these waffles, we make history.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups warm milk</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, baking powder and sugar; set aside. Preheat waffle iron to desired temperature.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Stir in the milk, butter and vanilla. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture; beat until blended.</li>
            <li>Ladle the batter into a preheated waffle iron. Cook the waffles until golden and crisp. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
